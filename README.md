# A Decade of Well-Being and happiness in Bangladesh: An Analysis Based on the World Happiness Report (2014–2023)
The World Happiness Report, published by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network in partnership with other organizations like Gallup and the University of Oxford, is an annual report which contains articles and rankings of national happiness of a country based on subjective well-being of their populations. The report primarily uses data from the Gallup World Poll, which conducts survey in various countries using a standardized life evaluation question to the population of the country. It is widely recognized for its global happiness rankings which evaluates the long-term trends and socio-economic conditions that influence both individual and collective life satisfaction across different countries. 
This project aims to analyze the wellbeing and happiness in Bangladesh over a ten-year period, from 2014 to 2023, using data from the World Happiness Reports. The focus is on understanding the factors that contribute to happiness in Bangladesh and how they have changed over time. This analysis provides valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and the general public to better understand societal well-being.

# Tools & Technologies Used	

# SQL	
SQL was used to extract and analyse Bangladesh-specific data from the World Happiness Report. Using SELECT, WHERE, and ORDER BY commands, key indicators were filtered like GDP, life satisfaction, social support, and health expectancy. Queries were designed to identify top 10 values and trends over time (2014–present), enabling focused and efficient data analysis. (Full Query is attached to the file)
# Microsoft Excel
Excel was used for data cleaning and presenting in tabular format and also for statistical analysis.
# Tableau	
For Interactive dashboards and data visualization

# Data Analysis and Key Finding

# Descriptive Analysis (Using Excel) 

•	Calculated mean, median, minimum, and maximum values for each variable over the 10 years.

•	Observed that Happiness Score ranged between 3.41 to 5.2 over the decade.

•	Notable increases were observed in GDP per capita and Healthy Life Expectancy.

•	Generosity and Perceptions of Corruption showed more fluctuation than stability.

 # Life Ladder (Happiness Index) Trends

•	Peak: 2020 (5.28)

•	Lowest: 2022 (3.41)

•	There was a sharp drop from 2020 to 2022, likely influenced by the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19 and political instability. 

# Economic Factors (GDP per capita)

•	Steady growth from 8.32 (2014) to 8.78 (2023).

•	Economic development has been consistently upward but this did not always correlate positively with happiness levels.

# Social Support

•	Declined sharply after 2020 (0.74) to 0.40 in 2022.

•	Indicates increasing social disconnection or dissatisfaction post-pandemic.

•	Social support is the most influential factors for happiness in Bangladesh; it influenced the ladder score over past ten years. 

# Health Indicators

•	Healthy Life Expectancy increased gradually from 63.28 (2014) to 64.80 (2023).

•	Despite slow progress, it's a positive sign of better healthcare and living conditions.

# Freedom to Make Life Choices

•	Improved over the decade from 0.74 (2014) to 0.92 (2023).

•	Suggests a growing sense of autonomy and empowerment among citizens.

# Generosity

•	Generosity often negative or near zero. Slight increase in 2021 (0.09) and moderate in 2023 (0.02).

•	This may reflect economic constraints affecting charitable giving.

# Perceptions of Corruption

•	Remained relatively high, ranging from 0.62 to 0.79.

•	A small improvement from 0.62 (2022) to 0.76 (2023)

# Key Finding:

•	Happiness (Life Ladder) peaked during 2020, possibly due to family unity or government support during early pandemic stages.

•	Despite economic growth, happiness and social support decreased after 2020, highlighting non-economic dimensions of well-being.

•	Perceived corruption and social trust remain pressing concerns, potentially limiting the effectiveness of policy measures.

•	Freedom and life expectancy show upward trends, giving hope for long-term structural improvements.

# Recommendations

•	Enhance social support and wellbeing of the citizen.

•	Ensure people participation to improve trust and transparency of government. 

•	Continue to invest in health and education. 

•	Extend the analysis to compare Bangladesh with other South Asian countries.

•	Use more statistical analysis like linear regression for showing the influence of different factors over ladder score.

# Conclusion
The happiness of the people of Bangladesh has shown moderate improvement over the past decade. The data reveals a positive relationship between life satisfaction (Life Ladder) and social support. Although life expectancy and economic growth have increased during this period, their impact on overall well-being and happiness appears to be limited.
